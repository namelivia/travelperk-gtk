This is just a proof of concept for connecting a GTK UI with [travelperk-http-python](https://github.com/namelivia/travelperk-http-python/).
Dependencies need to be installed globally and currently it only supports limit functionality.
There are no immediate plans to make it complete.
To execute just run `./run`.

Before getting started retrieving querying information from the TravelPerk Web API you first need to [get an API Key](https://developers.travelperk.com/reference#authentication).
Then put your API key on the following path: `~/.travelperk/credentials`
